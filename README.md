This web app is a Sinatra MVC with CRUD capabilities. I made this so people can keep track of their extensive game backlog libraries that they haven't gotten to play yet but plan on doing so one day. You can view every game that any user has uploaded to their library, see who else has a game in their library, and share your library with other users! In order to run this app, fork this repo into your terminal, run 'bundle install', run 'rake db:migrate', and then finally run the command 'shotgun'. Open the provided localhost link in your browser, and you can start signing people up and adding games!
